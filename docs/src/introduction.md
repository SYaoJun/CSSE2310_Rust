# Introduction

Welcome to the UQEntropy Lab Book. This document serves as a comprehensive guide through the implementation and understanding of the UQEntropy password strength checker project.

In this lab book, we'll walk through the various aspects of the UQEntropy tool - from setting up the environment, analyzing the code structure, understanding how it works, to building and testing the application.

The UQEntropy tool is designed to evaluate the strength of passwords based on entropy calculations. It also includes advanced features such as dictionary-based password matching with various transformation techniques like case-insensitive matching, digit appending, double-word combinations, and leet-speak transformations.

This lab will guide you through each component of the system and explain how they work together to provide a comprehensive password strength analysis tool.
